# password-generator

## Description

- My motivation came from wanting to be able to use the knowledge I learned about JavaScript to make a password generator that randomizes a password for the user after they input their criteria for the password.
- I worked on this project to test my knowledge of JavaScript and to see if I could put my knowledge to the test and create a password generator.
- The problem that this project solves is having a webpage that will generate a password for a user with criteria for how long they would like their password to be and what kind of characters they want in it as well.
- I learned that I am able to put the skills I learned in class to create a password generator website using JavaScript.
